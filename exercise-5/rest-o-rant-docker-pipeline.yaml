          The REST-o-rant app is now live on your local Docker Engine. Open the following link in a new browser tab or window:

          http://localhost:8181/

          You should see a text saying "Find the best restaurants near you!". Type "Cow" in the search bar and click "Search" to find the "Old Red Cow" restaurant.

          When everything looks OK, complete this task to continue the release and undeploy the application.
